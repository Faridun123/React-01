# What is React?
## React is an open source  JavaScript library for  developing user interfaces. 
## React can be used to 
## develop single page and 
## mobile applications.


# Who supports React
## React is developed and 
## maintained by Facebook
## and a community of 
## individual developers 
## and corporations.

# Why learn React?
## React saves you time and money on 
## development because it's 
## component-based. You can break 
## down an interface into reusable 
## components that allow you to build 
## dynamic user interfaces. This taps 
## into the current thinking behind 
## 'Design Systems'.

# What is NodeJs
## Node.js is a server-side 
## platform built on Google 
## Chrome's JavaScript Engine 
## (V8 Engine). Node.js was 
## developed by Ryan Dahl in 
## 2009.

# What is NPM 
## npm is the default package 
## manager for the JavaScript 
## runtime environment 
## Node.js.

# Create React App
## 1. Create a new folder with name of ReactApplications in 
## Documents
## 2. Open Directory in Visual Studio Terminal 
## 3. Type below command


npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

# What is DOM?

## The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming 
## interface for web documents. It represents the page 
## so that programs can change the document 
## structure, style, and content.

# What is Virtual DOM?
## A virtual DOM object is a representation 
## of a DOM object, like a lightweight copy

# Introducing JSX

## This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.
## It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We 
## recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look 
## like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with 
## the full power of JavaScript.

# Why JSX?
## React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently 
## coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the 
## state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for 
## display.
## React doesnâ€™t require using JSX, but most people find it 
## helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the 
## JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful 
## error and warning messages
